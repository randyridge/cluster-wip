# Intro

So what're we doing here?  I'm setting up a home lab kubernetes cluster.  Why?  It's something to fiddle with...

[Act 1 - What a cluster!](./what-a-cluster/what-a-cluster.md) 

Wherein we create a kubernetes cluster from scratch on a virtual machine for no apparent reason.  We use  [talos linux](https://www.talos.dev/), a virtual machine, and [cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template).  It's pretty easy to do, go check it out.

[Act 2 - Finish up](./finish-up/finish-up.md)

After creating our kubernetes cluster, we're on the internet!  Amaze.  Let's tidy a few things up.

[Act 3 - Next time?](./next-time/next-time.md)

What will we do next time???
