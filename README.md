# Intro

So what're we doing here?  I'm setting up a home lab kubernetes cluster.  Why?  It's something to fiddle with...

[Act 1 - What a cluster!](./what-a-cluster/what-a-cluster.md) wherein we create a kubernetes cluster from scratch on a virtual machine for no apparent reason.  We use  [talos linux](https://www.talos.dev/), a virtual machine, and [cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template).  It's pretty easy to do, go check it out.

[Act 2 - Quiet reflection](./quiet-reflection/quiet-reflection.md) after creating our kubernetes cluster, we're on the internet!  amaze.  What does it mean?  What next?
