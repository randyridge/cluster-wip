# Intro

So what're we doing here?  I'm setting up a home lab kubernetes cluster.  Why?  It's something to fiddle with...

[Act 1 - What a cluster](./what-a-cluster/what-a-cluster.md) 

Wherein we create a kubernetes cluster from scratch on a virtual machine for no apparent reason.  We use  [talos linux](https://www.talos.dev/), a virtual machine, and [cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template).  It's pretty easy to do, go check it out.

[Act 2 - Finish up](./finish-up/finish-up.md)

After creating our kubernetes cluster, we're on the internet!  Amaze.  Let's tidy a few things up.

[Act 3 - Echo chamber](./echo-chamber/echo-chamber.md)

Our echo service has served its purpose, we need to part ways.  We learn how to modify our cluster's
running state by removing the echo service to see the process and the effects.

[Act 4 - Next time?](./next-time/next-time.md)

What will we do next time???
